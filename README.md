**BadgerFlow** is a dashboard for UW-Madison students that displays the current hours, availability, and activities for the main gyms (_Nicholas Recreation Center, Bakke Recreation Center, The Shell_) and libraries (_College, Memorial, Law, Steenbock_). Some key features:
- Tracking of each region in every building throughout the day, logging people/capacity and current activity.
- Pin regions to mark as 'favorites' for easier access 
- Database that stores past availabilities and recommends when certain regions are busiest from past weeks/years.

Developed using React.js + CSS (_Frontend_), Python + PostgreSQL (_Backend/Data Analysis_), Jenkins (_CI/CD_).

Currently under development.
