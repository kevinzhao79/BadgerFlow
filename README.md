**BadgerFlow** is a dashboard for UW-Madison students that displays the current hours, availability, and activities for the main gyms (_Nicholas Recreation Center, Bakke Recreation Center, The Shell_), libraries (_College, Memorial, Steenbock_), and other campus buildings. Some key features:
- Tracking of each region in every building throughout the day, logging how busy each location is as well as its current and upcoming activities.
- Pinning regions marks them on your home page for easier access
- Login system to store pins across multiple devices
- Database that stores past data and recommends when certain locations are busiest from past weeks/years.

Developed using React.js + CSS (_Frontend_), Python + PostgreSQL (_Backend/Data Analysis_), Jenkins (_CI/CD_).

Currently under development by Kevin Zhao (/kevinzhao79) and Alan Liang (/liang-alan).
